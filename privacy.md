# Two tales of Privacy

Privacy is defined as *"someone's right to keep their personal matters and relationships secret; the state of being alone."* ([Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/privacy)).

Examples: *"The new law is designed to protect people's privacy."* and *"I hate sharing a bedroom - I never get any privacy."*

## We have a problem

And the problem lays right in the definition above.
It's not exactly wrong: by definition, a definition can't be wrong... Right? (♠_♦)

**But it doesn't match what privacy is in our everyday lives**. Especially not digital privacy.

That's because the definition implies that privacy is **binary**: some matters are secret and some are public. This is the "Walled Garden" view.

But in practice, we expect privacy to be much more **modular**. That's what we'll illustrate as the "Mask Collection" view.

Let's dive in.

## Binary privacy or the Walled Garden

The definition above implicates that privacy is **binary**:
* Each of us has a secret **walled garden**. In our gardens are our **private** pieces of information. Only us, as garden owners, can access it: privacy is bound to "being alone".
* On the other side of the wall, there's the open world. Information that we place beyond our wall is accessible to other people. So it's **not private** anymore.

There are two issues with this binary privacy view:
1. It doesn't map to our everyday lives.
2. It's dangerous, because it paves the ways to arguments such as "I have nothing to hide".

### Binary privacy doesn't add up

I disclose my home address to Amazon, but I'd rather not share it with my music service.
I disclose my health data to Google Fit, but I don't want my insurance to see it.
I'm fine with my friends knowing which stupid videos I watch at home, but maybe I don't want my employer to know about it ("Badger Badger", anyone?).
I'm disclosing my salary to an online real estate concellor, but I'm not comfortable with all my friends knowing about it.

So... it looks like privacy is not really about separating `me` from `other people`. If it was so, never would I disclose seemingly private information to anyone.

We've hit a nerve: "disclosure".
Quite paradoxically, disclosure makes a piece of data private -
What makes a piece of data private?
Intimacy? No.

### It's dangerous

It paves the ways to arguments such as "I have nothing to hide". // todo why does it pave the way.
... Nothing to hide? From whom, exactly?

# Modular privacy or the Mask Collection

The counter-intuitive thing about privacy is that it's **social**.
Social ---> network.

That's why attempts like [this](https://github.com/csharrison/conversion-measurement-api) are potentially dangerous: all in the same box!

# Privacy as Trust

Think about when you're really pissed of: it's when your stuff is used in ways you haven't intended.

"reasonable EXPECTATION of privacy" (see habeas data book) - expectation as trust!! Trust *is* a form of expectation, in a way.

# Babel's mess: A note on language

Especially Europe.

## French

I was shocked to see that Google translates "privacy" as "intimité". "Intimité" translates back to "intimacy". Aka sex health etc - some topics are intrisically intimate. But what about your movements during the day?? See marauders' map. Seems anecdotic but can be dangerous!!

Privatsphäre {f}

# The secret problem about privacy
# Privacy: the weird parts

Privacy is in all technology news. But I realized that we don't really think about what exactly the word means - at least, I didn't.
What is privacy, really?

# Binary privacy

<!-- Mask collection - Graph / Network / Star / A castle where different people have different entrances / underground -->

One of my friends argued "I have nothing to hide".  
There's something interesting in this argument: it implies that that privacy is about separating yourself from others.  
binary - Either something is private, aka secret and hidden from everyone's eyes, or it's public.

* "Separating from the eyes of others/ keeping things secret" // Y if someone hacks my personal network, N in the OKCupid or revenge porn case. In that definition, "once we share something, it's no longer secret, and we lose control of it.".

You share different things with different actors. 

<!-- * Privacy as intimacy: What's intimate is private (sex life, health data, salary) // Y for revenge porn, but N for "the transfer of personal data between websites, targeted advertisment..." -->

<!-- * Associated to specific physical spaces "behind closed doors" // Y if someone breaks into my home, but N/A in the digital space.
* freedom from
* freedom for -->

# What privacy is

* **Privacy is SOCIAL**: we have different sorts of relationships with others. Your life partner, your doctor, your lawyer. And we do disclose information to them ; but we expect that this information is used as expected. "Something about the social context of disclosure is the key to determining what's private and not - and that key is trust". What, when, why and with whom we share info, is key to determining whether it's private.

* We should be able to **wear the masks** we want! Persona. Modular. Not all in the same box.

# We have a choice
World 1: "the only things that remain private are these that we keep secret"
World 2: "Information can be shared with others without the entire world looking in"

## "I have nothing to hide"  
## "I'm happy to get targeted advertisements" // yes, but it's more than that. It transforms your world. that determines what you see, what you learn...

I'm OK with them doing money over my data since I'm not using it anyways. (Tomek)

A few weeks ago, I was having dinner at my friends' place. We were six people and some of use didn't know each other beforehand. The conversation revolved around what we love about Berlin, housing, dating, drinks, what mezzazines are, and to some extent our jobs.
It was the first time I was telling a group of friends about my job since I've started in a new role. I quickly noticed that, contrary to my previous role that didn't seem to interest people that much (they'd politely nod and just pour some more wine in their glass, so we'd switch topic to talk about them or siblings, an excellent topic).
