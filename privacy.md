# What privacy is

* Privacy is SOCIAL: we have different sorts of relationships with others. Your life partner, your doctor, your lawyer. And we do disclose information to them ; but we expect that this information is used as expected. "Something about the social context of disclosure is the key to determining what's private and not - and that key is trust". What, when, why and with whom we share info, is key to determining whether it's private.

* We should be able to **wear the masks** we want! Persona. Modular. Not all in the same box.

# We have a choice
