the mosaic: the whole tells more about you than the sum of its parts



You have something to hide - series:

* Part 1: Two tales of Privacy
* Part 2: Privacy as Trust
* Part 3: Privacy on the street vs. privacy in the books
* Part 4: You have something to hide

Disclaimer: none of the ideas exposed in this writeup are new. But all of them seem to be hiding in plain sight, benefitting from the noise of privacy breaches and Facebook statements. *You privacy is paramount to us* this, *We care about your privacy (as a title of a cookie modal with no options, how ironic)* that.

# Two tales of Privacy

Cambridge dictionary defines privacy as *"someone's right to keep their personal matters and relationships secret; the state of being alone."* ([Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/privacy)).

Examples: *"The new law is designed to protect people's privacy."* and *"I hate sharing a bedroom - I never get any privacy."*

We have a problem with this definition.
Surely a definition can't be *wrong*. By definition. Right?
But it **doesn't match what we expect privacy to be in our daily lives**. Especially not in our digital lives.

## Binary privacy or the Walled Garden

Imagine the world as described by definition above.
Each of us has a secret **walled garden**. You keep your **private** pieces of information in your garden. Only you, as a garden owner, can access it: privacy is bound to "being alone". On the other side of the wall, there's the open world. Information that you place beyond our wall is accessible to other people. As soon as you push some data outside of you garden's realm, it's **not private** anymore.
In this world, privacy is **binary**: a piece of information is either private or pubic.

### Why is doesn't add up

Wait. You're probably OK with your friends knowing about the witty videos your watch at home. But does it mean you want your employer to know about them ("Badger Badger", anyone?)? Likely not. You might disclose your home address to Amazon, but you'd rather not share it with your music streaming service. And so on.
Not because you share a piece of information means that you're ready to make it public.
A great illustration of this is the 2016 OKCupid Data breach. user shared information about their fetishes and sexual preferences with the OKCupid website https://fortune.com/2016/05/18/okcupid-data-research/ When a group of researchers published it - although it was already out in the internet - they felt their privacy was violated, and rightfully so.

So privacy is not about separating `me` from `other people`.

<!-- If it was so, you would never disclose a private piece of information would never be disclosed. -->
We've hit a nerve: "disclosure". This is counter-intuitive, but the context in which a piece of information was disclosed makes it private or not.
Put it simply: if you trust that a piece of information should remain between you and the service you shared it with, this makes it private. It's a bit like ... : just saying it makes it true.
"I think, therefore I am"

<!-- What makes a piece of data private?
Intimacy? No. -->

so it's not absolute: it's a matter of expectation.









But in practice, we expect privacy to be much more **modular**. That's what we'll illustrate as the "Mask Collection" view.

<!-- secret -->

There are two issues with the binary privacy view:
1. It doesn't map to our everyday lives.
2. It's dangerous, because it paves the ways to arguments such as "I have nothing to hide".

### It's dangerous

It paves the ways to arguments such as "I have nothing to hide". // todo why does it pave the way.

... Nothing to hide? From whom, exactly?

# Modular privacy or the Mask Collection

The counter-intuitive thing about privacy is that it's **social**.
Social ---> network.

That's why attempts like [this](https://github.com/csharrison/conversion-measurement-api) are potentially dangerous: all in the same box!

* DID recommendations

## GDPR and the california consumer protection act go in the same direction
Anything that can link to you is considered personal; data.

# Privacy as Trust

Think about when you're really pissed of: it's when your stuff is used in ways you haven't intended.

2 screenshots about phone number: which one are you the most likely to share??

"reasonable EXPECTATION of privacy" (see habeas data book) - expectation as trust!! Trust *is* a form of expectation, in a way.

# Babel's mess: A note on language

Especially Europe.

## French

"Confidentiel" - confidential is such a great word.
A confidence is a secret you tell someone, you whisper to them, and they keep to themselves.

I was shocked to see that Google translates "privacy" as "intimité". "Intimité" translates back to "intimacy". Aka sex health etc - some topics are intrisically intimate. But what about your movements during the day?? See marauders' map. Seems anecdotic but can be dangerous!!


Confidentitiality = confidences = that's exactly what disclosure is!
And the french "confidence" in english is ... TRUST.

## German

Privatsphäre {f}
Datenschutz {m}

# What the law says
Reasonable expectation of privacy





# The secret problem about privacy
# Privacy: the weird parts

Privacy is in all technology news. But I realized that we don't really think about what exactly the word means - at least, I didn't.
What is privacy, really?

# Binary privacy
<!-- Smoke screen - Wall: your house + a wall + the outside world  / Bubble -->
<!-- Mask collection - Graph / Network / Star / A castle where different people have different entrances / underground -->

<!-- p.2/3 -->

One of my friends argued "I have nothing to hide".  
There's something interesting in this argument: it implies that that privacy is about separating yourself from others.  
binary - Either something is private, aka secret and hidden from everyone's eyes, or it's public.

* "Separating from the eyes of others/ keeping things secret" // Y if someone hacks my personal network, N in the OKCupid or revenge porn case. In that definition, "once we share something, it's no longer secret, and we lose control of it.".

You share different things with different actors. 

<!-- * Privacy as intimacy: What's intimate is private (sex life, health data, salary) // Y for revenge porn, but N for "the transfer of personal data between websites, targeted advertisment..." -->

<!-- * Associated to specific physical spaces "behind closed doors" // Y if someone breaks into my home, but N/A in the digital space.
* freedom from
* freedom for -->

# What privacy is

* **Privacy is SOCIAL**: we have different sorts of relationships with others. Your life partner, your doctor, your lawyer. And we do disclose information to them ; but we expect that this information is used as expected. "Something about the social context of disclosure is the key to determining what's private and not - and that key is trust". What, when, why and with whom we share info, is key to determining whether it's private.

* We should be able to **wear the masks** we want! Persona. Modular. Not all in the same box.

# We have a choice
World 1: "the only things that remain private are these that we keep secret"
World 2: "Information can be shared with others without the entire world looking in"

# Arguments and dangers
contre-arguments: ML risks (they know sthg about you that you don't even), mixup everything risks ant state surveillance, **SOCIAL** risks (at the society's level, not just the individual)
## "I have nothing to hide"  
## "I'm happy to get targeted advertisements" // yes, but it's more than that. It transforms your world. that determines what you see, what you learn... 
## "It's too late anyways, 'they' have too much data" // no, because you change 
## "I wouldn't make money w that data anyways" The potato field paradigm
I'm OK with them doing money over my data since I'm not using it anyways. (Tomek)

soil = your data

Contre-arguments:
* That's because you don't have a choice
* It's more that they'd build fence around the field
* ... todo find a good metaphor to explain the
* The whole thing is more than the sum of its parts (see the marauder's map)



# Privacy vs personal data

# Privacy and security

# Own your data

A few weeks ago, I was having dinner at my friends' place. We were six people and some of use didn't know each other beforehand. The conversation revolved around what we love about Berlin, housing, dating, drinks, what mezzazines are, and to some extent our jobs.
It was the first time I was telling a group of friends about my job since I've started in a new role. I quickly noticed that, contrary to my previous role that didn't seem to interest people that much (they'd politely nod and just pour some more wine in their glass, so we'd switch topic to talk about them or siblings, an excellent topic).
