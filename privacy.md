Privacy is in all technology news. But I realized that we don't really think about what exactly the word means - at least, I didn't.
What is privacy, really?

# Binary privacy
<!-- Smoke screen - Wall: your house + a wall + the outside world  / Bubble -->
<!-- Mask collection - Graph / Network / Star / A castle where different people have different entrances / underground -->

<!-- p.2/3 -->

One of my friends argued "I have nothing to hide".  
There's something interesting in this argument: it implies that that privacy is about separating yourself from others.  
binary - Either something is private, aka secret and hidden from everyone's eyes, or it's public.

* "Separating from the eyes of others/ keeping things secret" // Y if someone hacks my personal network, N in the OKCupid or revenge porn case. In that definition, "once we share something, it's no longer secret, and we lose control of it.".

You share different things with different actors. 

<!-- * Privacy as intimacy: What's intimate is private (sex life, health data, salary) // Y for revenge porn, but N for "the transfer of personal data between websites, targeted advertisment..." -->

<!-- * Associated to specific physical spaces "behind closed doors" // Y if someone breaks into my home, but N/A in the digital space.
* freedom from
* freedom for -->

# What privacy is

* **Privacy is SOCIAL**: we have different sorts of relationships with others. Your life partner, your doctor, your lawyer. And we do disclose information to them ; but we expect that this information is used as expected. "Something about the social context of disclosure is the key to determining what's private and not - and that key is trust". What, when, why and with whom we share info, is key to determining whether it's private.

* We should be able to **wear the masks** we want! Persona. Modular. Not all in the same box.

# We have a choice
World 1: "the only things that remain private are these that we keep secret"
World 2: "Information can be shared with others without the entire world looking in"

# Arguments and dangers
contre-arguments: ML risks, mixup everything risks, **social** risks
## "I have nothing to hide"  
## "I'm happy to get targeted advertisements" // yes, but it's more than that. It transforms your world. that determines what you see, what you learn... 

## The potato field paradigm
I'm OK with them doing money over my data since I'm not using it anyways. (Tomek)

soil = your data

Contre-arguments:
* That's because you don't have a choice
* It's more that they'd build fence around the field
* ... todo find a good metaphor to explain the

## "It's too late anyways, 'they' have too much data"

A few weeks ago, I was having dinner at my friends' place. We were six people and some of use didn't know each other beforehand. The conversation revolved around what we love about Berlin, housing, dating, drinks, what mezzazines are, and to some extent our jobs.
It was the first time I was telling a group of friends about my job since I've started in a new role. I quickly noticed that, contrary to my previous role that didn't seem to interest people that much (they'd politely nod and just pour some more wine in their glass, so we'd switch topic to talk about them or siblings, an excellent topic).
