# Ending the closure creepypasta 

JS Closures feel like urban legends. 
Everybody talks about them, you just nod and smile and give that empty look.   
But really, you've never seen them shine in your codebase. 

Or, so you think.

Let's look at two super simple, very concrete examples of closures: 
1. An ubiquitous use of closure
2. A quick refactoring that shows what's nice about them. 

3 minutes. 

1.   

"a stateful function." is one of the most helpful defs I've seen. So let's see how to transform some staeful code into a closure.
