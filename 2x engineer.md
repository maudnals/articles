# The 2X engineer

No, no. It's not what you think.

This is not about the myth of the 10X engineer. Why would one want to be one, and why this term has been conflated to be a synonym for "arrogant dev who refactors on their own and grow the tech debt for the whole team while still being adored by the management". 
I'm not sure what a 10X engineer exactly is - surely I've met people who match the above description, as well as people who quietly wildly increase the whole team's productivity (I don't know if the factor is a 10 - has anyone measured that anyways?). 

But I haven't met that many 2X engineers. 2X engineers are people working as software developers, who also happen to be different - they have two "X" chromosomes. Or they identify as such - same, same.
