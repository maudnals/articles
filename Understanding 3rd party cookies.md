# NanoTechsSnack: 3rd-party cookies in 5 minutes

// Tech snack: 3rd-party cookies

## Why am I reading this?
You're probably glad you're not the dev who had to implement the new GDPR feature.
 
## Cookies 101

### Def 
"An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. 
**The browser may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server. **
Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser â€” keeping a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol."

### Origins 
Cookies are used on the web since 1994.  
"The first use of cookies [...] was checking whether visitors to the Netscape website had already visited the site."

### Cookie dough - What are cookies made of?  
A cookie is simply a key-value pair.
Example:

### How are cookies set/get?
Set: 2 ways:
- server-side: see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Creating_cookies
- client-side: see document.cookie = "username=John Doe";
Get: 2 ways:
- server-side: see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Creating_cookies
- client-side: see document.cookie = "username=John Doe";

basically a HTTP request is made, with Set-Cookie header.

Note: 
If your cookie is set server-side, it will be readable by client code. 
(because you won't be able to use the HttpOnly flag)
So you're exposing your users to session hijacking: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Session_hijacking_and_XSS or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking


### Zoom on cookie flavours


o | first-party | third-party
---------|----------|---------
 session | good: bad:  | xx
 persistent | B2 | C2

So, which one is evil?
Technically, all cookies are similar.

The evil twin: 3rd party cookies and associated problems


Alread back then, some privacy issues were raised.
"Cookies were discussed in two U.S. Federal Trade Commission hearings in 1996 and 1997"

### How trackers work (or don't)


#### Trackers cryptonite
* DNT messages
* Set DNT in your browser
* Use a browser that does DNT by default
* Use browser extensions such as [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/)
* Delete your cookies regularly

### Side notes 

#### Existential crisis
Cookie use is not encouraged anymore. 
Alternatives to cookies.

* Cookies vs redux
* Cookies vs localStorage
* Cookies vs other Alternatives---> see wikipedia

- cookie set on user device vs sent to server, and how/when are they "set"/"sent"... ? See https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference#filter-by-property
- why is the cookie list in the URL bar and in devTools not the same length?
- what's the point of a third-party session cookie? see http://www.fonerepair.com/information/cookies_policy.html
- link between http request and cookie? +++ read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies
- Resource type: XHR vs script??? --> see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/ResourceType

What do the values mean? 
How to retrieve cookies? What if they're the same name?
Is there a way to know where the cookie come from?
